## Thesis Title: [Geogenic radon mapping of Hessen using Machine Learning Techniques](https://github.com/Madaar49/Masters_Thesis/tree/main)

## Overview

This research focused on spatial modelling of *Geogenic radonpotential (GRP)* in Hessen District using machine learning techniques, and environmental covariables. 

*Geogenic radonpotential (GRP)* is defined as the portion of radon emanation, that is predominantly associated with natural factors.

**Hypothesis :** Spatial variability of GRP is affected by environmental parameters related to soil, geology, meterology etc. Therefore, by modelling a relationship between known sampling points and their environmental co-variables, we can predict the radon potential in areas where the environmental co-variables are present but radon potentials are unknown.


## Data and Method
- geogenic radonpotential sampling data.

- 38 covariates related to geology, soil, climate, Uranium, DEM etc.

- Use spatial cross validation for feature selection.

-  Develop models such as `Random Forest`, `xGBoost`, `Suport Vector Regressor`, `Multi-Layer-Perceptron Regressor`

## Deliverables
